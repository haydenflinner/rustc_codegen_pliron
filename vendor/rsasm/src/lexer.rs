//! Tokenizer.
//!
//! The lexer is pull-based and its [`LexConfig`] is mutable between tokens.
//! That matters because directives such as `.arch` change how the *rest* of
//! the file is spelled: `#` starts a comment on x86 but an immediate on m68k,
//! `|` a comment on m68k but an operator elsewhere. A batch tokenizer would
//! have to guess; a pull lexer simply asks the config again for every token,
//! and the crate's parser reads a file one statement at a time so the
//! directive has run before the next statement is lexed.
