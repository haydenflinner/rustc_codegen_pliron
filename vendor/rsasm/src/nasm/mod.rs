//! The NASM dialect: its preprocessor, and the statements it hands on.
//!
//! NASM source is read a line at a time, as NASM itself reads it. Each line
//! goes through the preprocessor first ([`pp`]): macro parameters inside a
//! macro body, then the `%` directives, then single-line macros, then a
//! multi-line macro call. What is left is an ordinary line, which the lexer
//! reads with the NASM rules and [`stmt`] assembles: labels with or without a
//! colon, `times`, the `db` family, `equ`, the bracketed primitive directives
//! and instructions.
//!
//! A line the preprocessor did not change is lexed where it is, so its
//! diagnostics point into the file it was written in. A changed one is
//! lexed from its expansion, which becomes a file of its own in the source
//! map, named after the line it came from. A multi-line macro's body and a
//! `%rep` block are expanded the same way, and read back through the
//! preprocessor line by line, since `%rotate` and `%if` inside them can only
//! be decided as each line is reached.
//!
//! Much of what looks like directive syntax in NASM source — `section`,
//! `global`, `struc`, `align` — is macros in NASM's standard macro set,
//! wrapping primitive directives written in brackets. rsasm defines the same
//! macros, in [`stdmac`], so they behave the same way, `__SECT__` included.
//!
//! Every behaviour here was checked against NASM 2.16.03; see
//! `tools/nasm-diff`.
