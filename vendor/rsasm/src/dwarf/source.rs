//! Line information for the assembly source itself (`-g`, `--gdwarf-N`).
//!
//! Both references make a row for each instruction, at its line in the
//! source, and a compilation unit that describes the file; a numbered `.file`
//! means the source brings its own line table, and turns it off. How they
//! place the rows differs:
//!
//! - GNU as makes a row only where the line or file changes, in any code
//!   section. An instruction in a macro expansion is on the line that called
//!   the macro, one in a `.rept` or `.irp` on its line in the block, and one
//!   in an included file on its line in that file, which the file table names.
//! - llvm-mc makes a row for every instruction, in the first code section and
//!   those `.section` named as code afterwards, always in the main file: an
//!   instruction in any expansion is on the line of the outermost directive
//!   or call that expanded it. It also describes each label in the
//!   compilation unit. (An instruction on the last line of an included file
//!   is the exception: llvm-mc has returned to the including file by the time
//!   it looks the line up, and reads it from that file's buffer with a pointer
//!   into the other, so the number depends on where the two were allocated.
//!   rsasm gives the line in the included file.)
