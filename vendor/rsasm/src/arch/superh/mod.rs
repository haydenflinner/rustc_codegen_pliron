//! Hitachi/Renesas SuperH, big-endian (`sh`) and little-endian (`shl`). `EM_SH`.
//!
//! Every instruction is one 16-bit word; the two targets differ only in the
//! order its two bytes are laid down. The operand syntax is GNU as's: bare
//! register names, `#` immediates, `@`-prefixed memory operands, and `!` for
//! comments (with `#` a comment only at the start of a line, since it is the
//! immediate prefix everywhere else).
//!
//! The pieces: [`reg`] names the registers, [`operand`] parses the addressing
//! modes, [`insn`] is the opcode table, [`encode`] matches operands against it
//! and fills in the fields, and [`pcrel`] handles branches and PC-relative
//! loads, whose displacement is measured from the instruction plus four.
//!
//! `sh` and `shl` accept the whole SH-1 to SH-4A instruction set with the FPU,
//! which is what GNU as does by default. The aliases `sh1`, `sh2`, `sh2e`,
//! `sh3`, `sh3e`, `sh4` and `sh4a` select a big-endian `sh` restricted to that
//! CPU's instructions, as `sh-elf-as --isa=sh2` and so on do (`--isa=sh` for
//! `sh1`), so `.arch sh2` rejects an FPU instruction. SH-2A's 32-bit
//! instructions and the SH-DSP extensions are not assembled.
//!
//! The ELF header names the least capable CPU that has every instruction the
//! file uses, which [`cpu`] works out the way GNU as does.
