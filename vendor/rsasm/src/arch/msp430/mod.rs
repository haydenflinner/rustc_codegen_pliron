//! Texas Instruments MSP430 and MSP430X, the 16-bit low-power
//! microcontrollers, with the 20-bit MSP430X extensions. `EM_MSP430` (105).
//!
//! # Reference
//!
//! `msp430-elf-as` (binutils 2.47), which `tools/xas-diff/run.sh msp430
//! msp430x` compares against byte for byte, run with `-mcpu=430` or
//! `-mcpu=430x`. The instruction table is the reference's own
//! (`include/opcode/msp430.h`), and the encoder follows `msp430_operands` in
//! `gas/config/tc-msp430.c` case for case, since that function *is* the
//! definition of MSP430 GNU syntax: see [`insn`] for the instruction set,
//! [`operand`] for addressing, and [`reloc`] for which relocation each
//! operand gets.
//!
//! # Targets
//!
//! | Name | GNU as | ISA | `e_flags` |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `msp430` | `-mcpu=430` | the original 27 instructions | 11 (`MSP430x11`) |
//! | `msp430x` | `-mcpu=430x` | adds the 20-bit MSP430X set | 45 (`MSP430X`) |
//! | `msp430xv2` | `-mcpu=430xv2`, and GNU as's default | as `msp430x`, refusing what the CPUXV2 cores cannot do | 45 |
//!
//! GNU as picks the ISA from `-mmcu` too, by looking the device up in a table;
//! the three names above are the three answers it can come to.
//!
//! # Objects
//!
//! GNU as sets `linkrelax` for this target: the GNU linker relaxes MSP430
//! code, so nothing in a code section may be resolved in advance. Every
//! reference from an executable section is relocated, even a jump to the
//! label before it, and names the label itself rather than its section;
//! a difference of two labels in a code section becomes an
//! `R_MSP430_SYM_DIFF` pair. rsasm writes the same.
//!
//! Every object also gets a `.MSP430.attributes` section recording the ISA
//! and the small code and data model, and, for a non-empty `.data` or `.bss`
//! (and some other names), an undefined reference to the C runtime's
//! `__crt0_*` routine that initialises it, which is how GNU as keeps unused
//! startup code out of a link.
//!
//! # Lexing
//!
//! `;` starts a comment anywhere, `#` only in the first column (it is the
//! immediate prefix), and `{` separates statements. Numbers may carry a
//! Renesas-style suffix (`0FFh`), which in GNU as also stops a leading zero
//! from meaning octal.
//!
//! # Deliberate differences from the reference
//!
//! Where the reference writes something no linker can make sense of, rsasm
//! refuses the source instead:
//!
//! * operands an instruction does not take, which the reference ignores
//!   (`nop r5`, `mov r5, r6, r7`);
//! * a `pushm` or `popm` count outside 1 to 16, which it folds into the
//!   opcode;
//! * a polymorphic branch to anything but a label, whose addend it drops
//!   (`beq lab+2` branches to `lab`).
//!
//! And where the object differs without the linked program differing:
//!
//! * The polymorphic branches (`jump`, `beq`, `bgt`, …) need GNU as's `-mP`,
//!   and are always taken in their long form, as GNU as takes them without
//!   `-mQ`; rsasm accepts them without an option.
//! * `R_MSP430_SYM_DIFF`'s addend is zero, which is what the reference writes
//!   for all but the last such pair in a section, where it writes the
//!   negated value of the subtrahend. The GNU linker reads neither.
//! * A number `.set` after the code that uses it is written into the field;
//!   the reference relocates the field against the symbol.
//! * The `__crt0_*` references a `.section` directive adds follow the
//!   undefined symbols the file relocates against in the symbol table, where
//!   the reference puts them where the directive is.
//! * A bare number is a register (`mov 5, r6` moves `r5`) by value here and by
//!   spelling in the reference, which reads `0b101` and `0x0` as numbers and
//!   `010` as octal.
//!
//! # Not implemented
//!
//! `-ml` (the large memory model, which only changes the attributes), the
//! interrupt-state `NOP` warnings and insertion (`-mn`, `-my`), the silicon
//! errata options, `-mQ` assembly-time relaxation, and the `.profiler`,
//! `.refsym` and `.cpu` directives.
