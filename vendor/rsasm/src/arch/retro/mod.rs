//! The 8-bit families: Zilog Z80, MOS 6502, Intel 8080 and Intel 8051.
//!
//! Four backends share this module because they share a problem shape: byte
//! streams with 8-bit opcodes and little-endian 16-bit operands, no fixed
//! instruction width, and a 64 KiB address space. The Z80 and the 8080 also
//! share their *opcode* values — the 8080 set is the Z80 main page minus the
//! `EX AF,AF'`/`DJNZ`/`JR` corners — so [`i8080`] builds Intel mnemonics on top
//! of the tables in [`z80`] rather than repeating the bytes.
//!
//! **Flat binary is the intended output.** These machines predate ELF and have
//! no `EM_*` number, so [`Architecture::elf_machine`] returns 0 and
//! [`Architecture::data_reloc`] returns `None`; assemble with `-f bin`. An
//! unresolved external reference is therefore an error rather than a
//! relocation, which is the right answer for a target with no linker.
//!
//! ## Syntax
//!
//! Source is read in the 8-bit dialect unless another is asked for:
//! `lda #$12` and `lda (ptr),y` as cc65's ca65 reads them, `ld a,(ix+5)` and
//! `ex af,af'` as GNU as and vasm read Zilog source, `MVI A,12H` and `MOV
//! A,#12H` as the Macro Assembler AS reads Intel's. That dialect's
//! directives and the rules where those assemblers disagree are described
//! in the crate's `dialect` module; each backend was checked against its
//! reference in `tools/xas-diff`.
//!
//! In the GNU dialect the Z80 is lexed as GNU as for the Z80 lexes it: `;`
//! comments, `$12` and `12H` numbers. There is no GNU as for the other two,
//! and there the GNU lexer's `#` comment makes `lda #$12` unwritable, so the
//! 6502 backend accepts `$` as the immediate marker too (`lda $0x12`). See
//! [`mos6502`] for the details.
