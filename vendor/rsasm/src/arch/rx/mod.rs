//! Renesas RX. `EM_RX` (173).
//!
//! RX is a 32-bit CISC microcontroller with instructions from one to eight
//! bytes, little-endian throughout. This backend implements the RXv1
//! instruction set in GNU as syntax — `mov.l #1, r1`, `add 4[r1].w, r2` —
//! and checks every encoding against `rx-elf-as` from binutils 2.47.
//!
//! - [`reg`]: register, flag and condition names, and operand sizes
//! - [`operand`]: the operand grammar
//! - [`encode`]: bit fields, displacements, and the value-dependent choice of
//!   immediate width that most of RX's size classes come from
//! - [`branch`]: branches and their relaxation, including GNU as's synthetic
//!   long conditional branches
//! - [`insn`]: the instruction table
//! - [`reloc`]: `R_RX_*` numbers
//!
//! # Differences from GNU as that are known
//!
//! GNU as for RX is not a plain assembler: it relaxes branches and symbolic
//! immediates itself, and with `-relax` also leaves `R_RX_RH_RELAX` markers so
//! the linker can shrink them further. It does neither by default, which is
//! how the differential corpus runs it. The details that do not carry over:
//!
//! - GNU as writes the symbol's value into the field of a relocation against
//!   a symbol defined in the same file; rsasm leaves the field zero. The
//!   linker overwrites it either way.
//! - An unresolved `beq`/`bne` or other conditional branch is given the
//!   synthetic long form rather than GNU as's 16- or 8-bit one.
//! - GNU as picks a far conditional's `bra.w` pair by the displacement from
//!   the conditional, not from the `bra.w`, so a target 32,769 or 32,770
//!   bytes back gets a 16-bit field that silently wraps and branches forward.
//!   rsasm takes the 6-byte `bra.a` pair there, which reaches. (Its other
//!   relaxation rules, shrinking included, are followed; see
//!   [`Relaxation::Shrinking`](crate::arch::Relaxation::Shrinking).)
//! - A displacement must be a constant or a difference of labels, as in GNU
//!   as, but its `%gp()` exception is not supported.
//! - What needs one of GNU as's relocation expressions, a stack of `R_RX_SYM`
//!   and `R_RX_OP*` entries, is refused: a difference of symbols that are not
//!   in one section, such as `.long ext - .`, and `sub #sym`, which stores the
//!   symbol negated. RX has no single relocation for either; even `.long ext
//!   - .` has no 32-bit PC-relative one to stand in for the stack.
//! - A bare number as a branch target (`bra 5`) is an address here; GNU as
//!   sizes the branch as if the number were the displacement.
//! - Code goes in whatever section is current, `.text` by default, where GNU
//!   as uses the Renesas name `P`.
//!
//! # CC-RX source
//!
//! With `-d ccrx` the operands take the two things Renesas CC-RX adds
//! (R20UT3248EJ0115 chapter 5): bit length specifiers, `#imm:8` and
//! `dsp:16[r1]`, and the substitute register names `__PID_R0`-`__PID_R15`.
//! CC-RX uses the width a specifier names even where a shorter form fits,
//! while this backend always assembles the shortest, as GNU as does; so a
//! specifier is accepted only where it names the width of that form, and
//! refused otherwise. See `insn::check_bit_lengths`. For a branch to a
//! target that is not resolved in the file, CC-RX keeps a conditional branch
//! at 8 or 16 bits as GNU as does, where this backend gives the synthetic
//! long form noted above.
//!
//! Only RXv1 is implemented, which is what GNU as accepts without `-mcpu`:
//! the RXv2/RXv3 instructions (`movco`, `emaca`, `save`, the double-precision
//! set, three-operand `xor`, register forms of `stz`/`stnz`) are refused with
//! a diagnostic that says so.
