//! NEC/Renesas V850, and its successor RH850 (the V850E3V5 instruction set).
//!
//! Two targets share one backend:
//!
//! - `v850` is the original V850 instruction set and nothing more, which is
//!   what `v850-elf-as` assembles when given no `-m` option. The V850E and
//!   V850E2 additions (`callt`, `prepare`, `switch`, the 32-bit `mul`, ...)
//!   are refused, with a note that RH850 has them.
//! - `rh850` is GNU as's `-mv850e3v5`: everything V850E1, V850E2 and V850E2V3
//!   added, the RH850 instructions (`bins`, `rotl`, `loop`, `pushsp`, the
//!   17-bit branches, the 48-bit loads and stores), and the FPU-3
//!   floating-point set. `v850e3v5` and `v850e2v4` name it too.
//!
//! The syntax is GNU as's, which is what could be checked; see
//! `tools/xas-diff`. With `-d ccrh`, source written for Renesas's own CC-RH is
//! accepted too, following its manual: label-reference sigils, its
//! condition-suffixed mnemonics, and the instruction expansions that make its
//! `mov 0x10, r10` a `movea`. See [`ccrh`], whose output is checked against
//! the GNU-syntax sequence each expansion stands for.
//!
//! Instructions are 16, 32 or 48 bits, little-endian, and GNU as's choices
//! between forms are followed exactly, because they are what existing object
//! code contains: `mov 16, r1` takes 48 bits on RH850 because 16 does not fit
//! the 5-bit form, and a conditional branch grows from 2 to 4 to 6 bytes as
//! its target moves away. Objects use the RH850 ELF ABI, as GNU as's do by
//! default; see [`reloc`].
