//! Renesas RL78, the 16-bit microcontroller family that succeeded the 78K0R.
//! `EM_RL78` (197).
//!
//! # Reference
//!
//! The GNU syntax of `rl78-elf-as` (binutils 2.47), which is what
//! `tools/xas-diff/run.sh rl78` compares against byte for byte. There is no
//! independent specification of that syntax, so its grammar
//! (`gas/config/rl78-parse.y`) decided which operand shapes exist and the
//! reference's output decided every byte; see [`insn`] for the opcode map and
//! [`operand`] for the addressing syntax.
//!
//! # Lexing
//!
//! RL78's GNU port is unlike the GNU default in four ways, all confirmed
//! against the reference and applied through [`Architecture::tune_lexer`] and
//! [`Architecture::comments`]:
//!
//! * `;` starts a comment anywhere, and `#` only in the first column, since
//!   `#` is the immediate prefix. `//` is not a comment.
//! * `@` separates statements; `;` cannot, being the comment character.
//! * Renesas radix suffixes work: `0FFH`, `1010B`, `17O`, `99D`.
//! * A leading zero does not make a number octal: `010` is ten.
//!
//! `.word` is four bytes wide, as `.int` and `.long` are.
//!
//! # Deliberate differences from the reference
//!
//! * A constant that does not fit its field is an error naming the limit.
//!   The reference keeps the low bits of `mov a, #256` without a word.
//! * Branch relaxation picks the short form exactly when its displacement
//!   fits. The reference measures from the start of the instruction rather
//!   than its end, so it gives up on the short form a few bytes early going
//!   forward, and going backward it keeps it a few bytes too long — writing a
//!   displacement that has wrapped around (`bz` 127 bytes back becomes
//!   `dd 7f`, a branch forward).
//! * A relative branch to a target outside its section is an error. See
//!   [`reloc::rel8`] for why no relocation can be written for it.
//!
//! # CC-RL syntax
//!
//! Renesas's CC-RL writes operands with the same sigils GNU as uses, so with
//! `-d ccrl` the one difference left for the backend is CC-RL's shorthand
//! `[DE]` and `[HL]` for a zero displacement; see
//! `insn::implicit_zero_displacement`. Its directives and expressions are the
//! core's (`crate::dialect_cc`).
//!
//! # Not implemented
//!
//! The `%lo16`/`%hi16`/`%hi8`/`%code` relocation functions, `.3byte`, and the
//! `-mrelax` linker-relaxation relocations.
