//! NEC/Renesas 78K0, in the syntax of Renesas's CA78K0 assembler.
//!
//! # No reference assembler
//!
//! Every other backend in this crate is checked against GNU as or llvm-mc.
//! Neither supports the 78K0, and CA78K0 itself is a proprietary Windows tool,
//! so this one is verified the way the Z80 and 6502 backends are: against the
//! vendor's own documentation, with the tests walking the whole table. (The
//! RL78, which binutils does support, is a later and differently encoded
//! architecture; its encodings are no evidence for the 78K0's.)
//!
//! The documents, all published by NEC or Renesas:
//!
//! * *78K/0 Series User's Manual: Instructions*, U12326EJ4V0UM00, 4th
//!   edition (2001). Section 4.2 (pages 38–45) is the instruction code list
//!   that [`table`] transcribes; section 4.1.1 (page 32) the operand
//!   identifiers; chapter 3 (pages 20–31) the addressing modes, including how
//!   `CALLF`, `CALLT` and short direct addresses map onto memory.
//! * *RA78K0 Assembler Package User's Manual: Language*, U17198EJ1V0UM00
//!   (RA78K0 is the assembler in the CA78K0 package): the operand sigils
//!   (Table 2-8, page 38), bit terms (section 2.5, pages 65–67), operand
//!   ranges and which may be symbolic (Tables 2-19 and 2-21, pages 68–71), and
//!   the `BR` directive (section 3.7, pages 114–116).
//! * *78K0/Kx2 User's Manual: Hardware*, R01UH0008EJ0401, section 29.2
//!   (pages 761–768): the operation list, whose "Bytes" column the tests use
//!   as an independent check on every instruction length.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! * [`table`] — the code table, one [`table::Row`] per printed line.
//! * [`form`] — reads the rows, rejecting any whose columns disagree.
//! * [`operand`] — CA78K0 operand syntax.
//! * [`encode`] — matches operands to forms and emits bytes and fixups.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! * **Device SFR names.** CA78K0 takes SFR symbols such as `P0` or `PM0`
//!   from a device file selected with `$PROCESSOR`; they differ between 78K0
//!   devices, and the core has no `$PROCESSOR`. Guessing one device's names
//!   would silently mis-assemble another's, so SFRs are written as addresses
//!   or `EQU`s (`PM0 EQU 0FF20H`), which the manual allows for `sfr`
//!   operands (Table 2-21, note 5). `PSW` and `SP` are recognised, because
//!   the code table names them itself.
//! * **`HIGH`, `LOW` and the other word operators** of RA78K0 expressions
//!   (Table A-2), which belong to the core's expression parser.
//! * **Bit symbols** (`FLAG EQU 0FE20H.3`), which need `EQU` to accept a bit
//!   term.
//!
//! Flat binary is the intended output: CA78K0 writes its own object format,
//! not ELF, and no `EM_*` number was ever assigned to the 78K0.
