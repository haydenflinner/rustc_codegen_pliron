//! Microchip (formerly Atmel) AVR, the 8-bit microcontroller family. `EM_AVR`
//! (83).
//!
//! # Reference
//!
//! GNU binutils 2.47's `avr-elf-as`, which `tools/xas-diff/run.sh` compares
//! against for four cores (the default, `avr51`, `avrtiny` and an XMEGA with
//! the read-modify-write instructions), whole objects included, and whose
//! objects `tools/flat-diff/run.sh` links with `avr-elf-ld` to check flat
//! images. `tools/fuzz/avr.py` does both for random programs. The opcode
//! table, the MCU table and the operand rules are transcribed from
//! `include/opcode/avr.h` and `gas/config/tc-avr.c`; see [`insn`], [`isa`]
//! and [`operand`].
//!
//! # Targets
//!
//! `avr` is what `avr-elf-as` assembles without `-mmcu`: the AVR2 instruction
//! set, which has no `jmp`, `call`, `movw` or `mul`. The family names `avr1`
//! to `avr6`, `avrxmega1` to `avrxmega7` and `avrtiny`, and every device name
//! GNU as knows (`atmega328p`, `attiny85`, ...), select that core, from the
//! command line or with `.arch`. An instruction the core does not have is an
//! error, as it is there.
//!
//! # Linker relaxation
//!
//! `avr-elf-as` prepares every object for linker relaxation unless told
//! `-mno-link-relax`, and so does rsasm, which has no such option:
//!
//! * `e_flags` carries `EF_AVR_LINKRELAX_PREPARED` (0x80) next to the machine
//!   number.
//! * A branch or call to a label is relocated even within its own section,
//!   with the field left zero, since the linker may delete code between the
//!   two.
//! * A relocation against a local label names the label, not its section, so
//!   local labels that are referred to reach the symbol table.
//! * An `.align` or `.org` in a code section is recorded in `.avr.prop`, for
//!   the linker to keep while it deletes code; see [`prop`].
//!
//! # Lexing
//!
//! `;` starts a comment anywhere and `#` only in the first column, and `$`
//! separates statements, so it is not part of a name. Mnemonics and register
//! names are read in either case, and so are the modifiers of data (`.word
//! PM(main)`), but the modifiers of an `ldi` are lower-case only, as
//! `avr_ldi_expression` looks them up.
//!
//! `.` in an operand is the address of the next instruction: GNU as reserves
//! the instruction's bytes before it reads the operands, so `rjmp .` jumps
//! past itself.
//!
//! # Deliberate differences from the reference
//!
//! * A value that does not fit its field is an error naming the limit, where
//!   GNU as keeps the low bits of some of them, with a warning or without (a
//!   `call` target past 22 bits of word address, an AVR-tiny `lds`/`sts`
//!   address outside 0x40-0xbf, an `ldi` constant below -255). A number
//!   counted in words, `pm(3)`, has to be even, as GNU ld requires of a label.
//! * `ldd` and `std` need their displacement. GNU as reads one character past
//!   `Y` or `Z` looking for its `+`, which refuses `ldd r0, Y` except on the
//!   last line of a file.
//! * `lo8(gs(1))`, of a number, is `lo8(pm(1))`; GNU as stops with "unknown
//!   relocation type".
//! * Differences of two labels are written as numbers. Where GNU as writes a
//!   difference that crosses sections as an `R_AVR_DIFF*` relocation — in
//!   practice only in the DWARF it makes, since a difference within a section
//!   folds there too — rsasm writes the number the linker would start from
//!   without the relocation.
//! * `.arch` selects exactly the named core. GNU as adds the new name's
//!   instructions to those already allowed, and refuses a core with another
//!   machine number outright.
//!
//! # Not implemented
//!
//! The `__gcc_isr` pseudo-instruction (`-mgcc-isr`), and the warnings GNU as
//! gives for a skip over a two-word instruction and for operand combinations
//! with undefined results (`ld r26, X+`).
