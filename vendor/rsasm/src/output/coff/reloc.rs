//! The relocation mapping layer: what a fixup means in, COFF numbers out.
//!
//! Backends choose relocations as ELF numbers ([`Architecture::data_reloc`],
//! [`Architecture::modifier_reloc`], [`FixupKind::reloc`]), which is the one
//! numbering every one of them already has, and name in a
//! [`RelocClass`](crate::reloc::RelocClass) whatever a number alone cannot
//! say. COFF needs its own numbering, so the translation lives here rather
//! than in the backends: nothing about x86 or AArch64 changes when an object
//! comes out as PE/COFF, and the ELF writer never sees this file.
//!
//! Two things differ per relocation and both are answered here:
//!
//! - **Which number.** A COFF type is not always one-to-one with an ELF one:
//!   `R_X86_64_PC32`, `PLT32` and `GOTPCREL` all become
//!   `IMAGE_REL_AMD64_REL32`, since a Windows object has no PLT and no GOT
//!   for the assembler to name. The three things only COFF says — an
//!   image-relative address, an offset within a section, a section index —
//!   have no ELF number at all, and arrive as a class.
//! - **Where "here" is.** COFF's PC-relative relocations on x86 and for
//!   AArch64's `REL32` measure from the byte *after* the four-byte field,
//!   while AArch64's branches and `adrp` measure from the instruction. ELF
//!   measures from the field on all of them. [`pc_base`] is the difference,
//!   and it is what the in-place addend has to carry.
//!
